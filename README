PONG in Python! 

######################

INSTALLATION:

To play this version of the game (I'm creating a standalone executable), you will need numpy, skfuzzy and pyglet.

Create a folder where you want PONG to reside, and then clone my 
repository into your folder with the following:

    $ git clone https://github.com/SophiaMitchell/Python_PONG.git

To play the game, navigate to /Human_Game and simply type 
 
    $ python pong.py

#####################

CONTROLS:

Currently only the Human_Game  is ready to play. The left player 
uses "Q" and "A" to control their paddle, while the right player 
uses the up and down arrows. 

Now play! The first person to 4 points wins!

Stay tuned for the human vs fuzzy AI version...
